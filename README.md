But there is one big command system that is "!role", when you type it in you start a "minigame" and be putten in a user list where the correct answer is and also how many gesses you have done. After you have get putten in the list you are going to chose from 1 to 6 the rest can you see in the code and test on your own. There is a command to leave the list and that is "!quitrole".
